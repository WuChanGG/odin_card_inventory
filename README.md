# odin_card_inventory
You can test the project live at: https://wu-odin-inventory.herokuapp.com/inventory/cards

This project was for educational purposes and only focused on reinforcing my understanding of node, express, mongoose and middleware.

This is a project made for the NodeJS course provided by https://www.theodinproject.com/ .

It is a simple list of cards for a game. And you can:
- View all the cards in the database.
- Create "creature" cards.
- Delete "creature" cards.
- Update "creature" cards.
